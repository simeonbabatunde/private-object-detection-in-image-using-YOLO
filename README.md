# Private Object Detection in images using YOLO

You only look once (YOLO) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. In this project, yolov3 was used for identifying both public and private objects in a given image based on pretrained model.

This repository contains the code and documentation for detecting private and public objects in an image using YOLO algorithm. Detailed description can be found in the pdf doc.
